    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 stick of cold butter (To help get it really cold, put it in the freezer for a 20 minutes)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of baking powder</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450.</li>
            <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, and grate the butter into the flour like a block of cheese.
                It really helps if the butter is super cold.
            </li>
            <li>Add the baking powder.</li>
            <li>Gently combine all of these ingredients. Use your hands, and dont smash up your butter.</li>
            <li>Add the milk. Again, use your hands and mix into a dough.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour down on your counter, and spread the dough.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into rounds. No need for a fancy cutter, just use a drinking glass!</li>
            <li>Bake until the tops turn a nice golden brown. Ovens are different, and timing may vary based on how thick
                you cut your dough. I also put mine on the top rack to keep the bottoms from getting too done.
            </li>
        </ol>
