# Martin Recipe Project

## What Is It?
This project is the first one in the Odin Project! What I plan on doing is creating a simple website that stores some of my recipes. This will only be in HTML, so it will be pretty ugly, but the main point is to just practice the HTML skills that I have learned so far.

## The Skills Demonstrated
- Git usage.
- HTML boilerplate and page structure.
- HTML file structure.
- Navigation to and back away from recipe pages using relative links.
- Ordered and unordered lists.
- Adding images.
- Hosting the HTML on Github.
